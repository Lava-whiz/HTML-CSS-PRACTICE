        <h1>Persian Cat</h1> 
       <p>
        The Persian cat (Persian: گربه ایرانی‎, Gârbhe Irani) is a long-haired breed of cat characterized by its round face and short muzzle. It is also known as the "Persian Longhair" in the English-speaking countries. The first documented ancestors of the Persian were imported into Italy from Persia around 1620.Recognized by the cat fancy since the late 19th century, it was developed first by the English, and then mainly by American breeders after the Second World War. Some cat fancier organizations' breed standards subsume the Himalayan and Exotic Shorthair as variants of this breed, while others treat them as separate breeds.</p>

        <p>Doll Face Persian cats are also known as Traditional or Old Fashioned Persians. This variant is believed to be the original Persian cat. Today, these cats still look virtually the same as the oldest available images of Persian cats.This type of Persian does not exhibit extreme features. Its nose is a normal length, which is proportional to the rest of its face. 
        </p>

        <h3>Peke-Face:</h3>

        <p>Show Persian cats, or Peke-Face Persians, have the more recognizable Persian cat features. This breed’s name comes from their similarities to Pekingese dogs. A genetic mutation causes the flat face in this Persian variation.These cats have a square-shaped head, a small nose, and a long jaw. They also have round cheeks and large circular eyes.
        </p>

        <h3>Chinchilla:</h3>

        <p>Chinchilla Persian cats are a very striking variation. These cats have thick, bushy coats. They were originally named after the South American rodent that also possesses a thick, white coat. While there are a few different color-variations, Chinchilla Persian cats are typically silvery white. Their doll-like eyes, lips, and nose are rimmed in black. These cats have a light undercoat and a subtly-tinted overcoat. They also either have green or blue eyes.
        </p>

        <h3>Exotic Shorthair:</h3>

        <p>The Exotic Shorthair was bred to be the shorthair variant of a Persian cat. This variation exhibits most typical Persian characteristics. They have a flat face and large eyes. Unlike the longhair variations, these cats are capable of grooming themselves.Unfortunately, their facial structure causes the standard health problems related to Persian cats. </p>

        <h3>Teacup:</h3>
        <img src="images/Teacup-Persian.jpg" height="200px"  alt="a small grey cat in a tea-cup">
        <p>Teacup Persians are bred to be tiny. Breeders aim to produce the smallest Persian cats possible. And while these are adorable, you should think twice before adopting a Teacup Persian.Since these cats are bred to be small, their chances of experiencing health problems only increase. Persian cats already have small-squished faces. And smaller faces just make it even hard for Teacup Persian cats to breathe.</p>
